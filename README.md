# What is this project?

I downloaded a bunch of (royalty-free) sound files from Monument Studios, and wanted an easy way to use them in my D&D games. Rather than download something unknown, or try to use a tool like Serato, I decided to just build a simple soundboard that served my needs. 

# How to add your own sounds

(Instructions will go here once I have confirmed how to do this.)

# Limitations

Current limitations include:
* Adding too many sounds makes the dropdown options unruly.
* The background is boring
* Have not yet deployed it as a standalone exe.
* The Monument Studios royalty-free license is not included in the repo, since it counts for code statistics and makes the repo appear as `RTF` instead of `C#`

Additional `TODO` comments throughout the project indicate other areas which I want to expand or improve.
